<h3 align="left"><font color="white" size="5">Mechanical Engineering is always on the edge, moving in new directions and exploring new possibilities. From design, manufacturing and mechanical systems and structures the subject now studies bio-mechanical and biomechatronics. Mechanical engineer today are the forefront of developing new technology for environmental remediation, farming and food production, housing, transportation, safety, security, healthcare and water resources. The Department of Mechanical Engineering is one of the largest in ITER and Odisha. The B.Tech. programme focuses on the study of engineering of sciences, understanding of key concepts, theoretical and experimental solution of physical problems and design of systems relevant to the contemporary industrial needs and challenges. The faculty members are well experienced to sustain a lively and interactive teaching learning process in the class rooms. This approach stimulates the intellectual
curiosity and creativity of the students. Similarly, M.Tech. students and Ph.D. scholars work on Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, Heat Transfer, I.C. Engineer, Automobiler, Fluid Mechanics, Hydraulic Machines, Machine Dynamics, Material Testing Material Testing, Applied Mechanics, Control and Measurement,
CNC Machining, material science, solar energy, vibration and Bio-Mechanics. The Department has a well equipped workshop and machine shop. The department has also modern facilities for engineering graphics and computational analysis. The Department has licensed software like solid works 2009, Matlab 7.1, Ansys-CFD 14.3 and AutoCAD 2006 for modelling, simulation of real type domain problems. The students are updated with industry based knowledge in computer aided manufacturing laboratory. The departmental library has the latest books/titles from reputed publishers e.g. Elsevier, Springer-Verlag and Taylor-Francis.The department has the access to e-journals of Elsevier,ASME, Springer-Verlag and Taylor-Francis
publishers etc which helps our faculty members.  </font></h3><br><br>
