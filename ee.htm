<h3 align="left"><font color="white" size="5">As a core branch the department lives up to the developments taking place in the field of electricity eneration through hydro, thermal, nuclear and nonconventional sources. The department teaches distribution of electricity and use of new materials for different applications. The students get ample scope of learning modern technology with the help of qualified teachers. The department has been re-accredited by NBA, AICTE. Eminent professors are engaged in quality research and supervision of Ph.D. scholars.


The department has specific laboratories for Basic Electrical Engineering, Network Devices, Electrical Machines-I & II, Control and Instrumentation, Power Systems, Power Electronics, Electric Drives, Electrical Design and Simulation, Project Laboratories. 

A Computational Laboratory has been added to the department for carrying out Computer Aided research activities. Modernization and Removal of Obsolescence(MODROB) is regularly practiced in all the laboratories. A Robotics Laboratory is expected to function shortly. Basic Electrical Engineering and Network Devices Laboratory is meant for verification of Basic Principles of Electrical Engineering
and Laws of Electrical Networks. The Machine Lab is well equipped with modern electrical machines : single and three phase transformers with multi winding, DC & AC Motor Generator Sets, Induction and Synchronous Motors and Single Phase Motors to name a few. The Control and Instrumentation Lab. has Amplidyne Set, DC Position Control System, Data Acquisition System, PID Controller etc. The Power Electronics Lab. is equipped with Converter Rectifiers and Inverters both single phase and three phase, Cyclo Converter, IGBTbased Inverter and other modern equipment in related field. The Power System Lab is equipped with Relay Trainers, Oil Testing Kit, Current Injection Circuit, Artificial Transmission Line etc. The Power System Lab. is being augmented with advanced relay and protection systems, relevant power system software. The Laboratory will be having state of the art technology. The aim is to develop a knowledge intensive laboratory keeping in mind the need of theindustry with high competence levels. The laboratory helps in promoting research work for PG students and faculties. Renewable Energy Laboratory has already been set up for M.Tech. students. An advanced laboratory equipped with modern instruments is under preparation for M.Tech. students. Further, a new lab of High Voltage Engineering has been set up in viewof the requirement of the industry. The laboratory facilitates high voltage testing of electrical equipments.

The Department has its own computer lab to facilitate Computer Aided Electrical Machine Design, software based project work for final year Under Graduate students, students in the Post Graduate Program. This lab also promotes the faculty members for in-house R&D programme. The Department has its own Library having referred texts of international repute for faculty members & students. Interested faculties are regularly sponsored to carry out Post Graduate and Doctoral research programs in reputed institute outside SOA
University. The department has the necessary facilities to carryout doctoral work. A large number of faculty members have been engaged in carrying out their doctoral work.  </font></h3>
